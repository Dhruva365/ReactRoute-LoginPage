# ReactRoute-LoginPage

In this Learning project have used hooks like useState and also React Router specfic hooks like useNavigate and useLocation. Here its normal login page, if you logged in you will move to the Hompage where your username will be passed while you navigate from login page to homepage and will be displayed in homepage. If you refresh the home page the username will still be visible and also once you logged in you won't be able to redirect to login page from homepage.

One issue is left for handling that is if you manually changed the url to homepage it would render the homepage but it should only render after logged in.
